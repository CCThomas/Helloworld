## How to use Git
Add remote branch, allows you to push your changes to GitHub
```
git remote set-url origin <url_to_github_repo>
```
Add Changes
```
git add <file_to_add>
```
Commit Changes
```
git commit -m "Commit Message"
```
Pull from Branch, helps avoid merge conflicts
```
git pull <branch-name>
```
Finally Push to Branch
```
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

## Formatting README
You can have plain text

* Or some bullets
  * Maybe Some nested bullets
  
> Also what ever this is

> If you do not put a space between ">"
> It will put them on the same line!
